# footprints-selector
A Chrome extension written for Northwestern IT to auto-select the Walk-In Location field on Footprints.

## About
This extension was developed out of laziness and forgetfulness. While at work, I frequently forgot to select the Walk-In Location field, and we are unable to make it mandatory, so I took matters into my own hands.

This prompts a user for their location, either `library` or `sherman`, whenever they are on the FootPrints login screen. It then saves that to Chrome storage, and uses it to automatically populate the Walk-In Location field when editing tickets.

## Installation
1. Click the green "Clone or download" button, then Download ZIP.
2. Unzip the repository somewhere.
3. Visit `chrome://extensions` in your browser, or open up the Chrome menu > More Tools > Extensions.
4. Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right is checked.
5. Click "Load unpacked extension ..." to pop up a file-selection dialog.
6. Select the directory you just created.

That should be all you need to get started. Please email me with any questions or bug reports.
